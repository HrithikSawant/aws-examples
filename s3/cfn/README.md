# S3 Bucket Deployment via CloudFormation (CNF)

This project demonstrates how to create an simple Amazon S3 bucket using AWS CloudFormation (CNF). It provides a simple `template.yaml`.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **AWS CLI**  
   Ensure that the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) is installed and properly configured with appropriate IAM permissions for deploying CloudFormation stacks and managing S3 resources.  

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

---

## Files in the Project

1. **`template.yaml`**  
   A CloudFormation template that defines an S3 bucket resource. No bucket name is specified in the template, allowing AWS to generate a unique name.

2. **`deploy`**  
   A Bash script to deploy the CloudFormation stack containing the S3 bucket.

3. **`delete`**  
   A Bash script to delete the CloudFormation stack and clean up the associated resources.

---

## Steps to Run the Demo

### 1. Deploy the S3 Bucket

Run the `deploy.sh` script to deploy the S3 bucket using the provided CloudFormation template. Note update the bucket and file path.

```bash
chmod +x deploy
./deploy
```

**Output:**  
The script will deploy the CloudFormation stack with the name `cfn-s3-simple-hrithik-fg0293475`. It will also validate the template using the `--no-execute-changeset` flag, ensuring no changes are made during validation.

---

### 2. Verify the Deployment

After running the deployment script, you can verify the deployed stack and resources:

1. **CloudFormation Console**:  
   Navigate to the [AWS CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) and locate the stack named `cfn-s3-simple-hrithik-fg0293475`.

2. **S3 Console**:  
   Go to the [Amazon S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/) to view the bucket created by the stack.

---

### 3. Delete the S3 Bucket

To clean up the resources and delete the bucket, use the `delete` script.

```bash
chmod +x delete
./delete
```

**Output:**  
The script will delete the CloudFormation stack `cfn-s3-simple-hrithik-fg0293475`, removing the associated S3 bucket.

---

## Notes

- **Region**:  
  Update the `your-region` placeholder in the `deploy` script with your desired AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`).

- **Bucket Name**:  
  The bucket name is auto-generated by AWS, ensuring it is unique. If a custom name is required, update the `template.yaml` file to include a `BucketName` property.

- **IAM Permissions**:  
  Ensure your AWS CLI credentials have the necessary permissions for creating CloudFormation stacks and managing S3 resources.
